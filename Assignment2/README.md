This is my assignment 2 folder.
To create bold or italic, wrap with asterisks or underscores. For Italics use one * on each side of what you want to be in italics. For bold, you need to use two ** on either side of what you want to be in bold. 
For a line break, add either a backslash \ or two blank spaces at the end of the line. 
Starting a line with a hash # and a space makes a header. The more # , the smaller the header is.
