            This photo shows Paul and Chani walking through the desert. This photo did not 
            happen in the film, however it shows them plotting their next moves as they head into
            the Holy War with the rest of the Great Houses.

            Where does Chani go at the end of Dune 2?
            Chani's departure on the sandworm at the end of Dune 2 sets the state for her to have a different role in Dune 3 than she did in the book.
            Chani will likely return to the Fremen's South Sietch.
